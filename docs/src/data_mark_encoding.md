# Building Blocks of a Vega-Lite Visualization

The `data`, `mark` and `encoding` properties of a Vega-Lite specification are the basic building blocks of a Vega-Lite visualization. In Deneb.jl, sub-specifications for these properties can conveniently be defined using `Data`, `Mark`, and `Encoding` and then composed using the `*` operator to build the final specification.

```@example building_blocks
using Deneb
cars = "https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json"
Data(url=cars) * Mark(:point) * Encoding(
    "Horsepower:q",
    "Miles_per_Gallon:q",
    color=:Origin
)
```

## Data

Similar to Vega-Lite, in Deneb.jl a dataset can be defined in several ways:
- as tabular data,
- as a URL from which to load the data,
- or as any of Vega-Lite's data generators.

### Tabular data

Deneb.jl accepts any tabular data that supports the [Tables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl) interface (e.g. [DataFrames.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl) or any of [these formats](https://github.com/JuliaData/Tables.jl/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS.md)) by simply passing the data to `Data`.

```@example building_blocks
data = (a=[1, 2], b=["potato", "tomato"])
Data(data)
```

In the example above the source data was simply a `NamedTuple`, but it could've been for instance a `DataFrame`.

```@example building_blocks
using DataFrames
Data(DataFrame(data))
```

As shown in the output, Deneb.jl internally transforms this data into an appropriate spec with a format that Vega-Lite can interpret.
### Data from a URL

Alternatively, data can be loaded from a URL using the `url` keyword argument.

```@example building_blocks
Data(url="https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json")
```

Other properties can be specified to ensure that the loaded data is correctly parsed by Vega-Lite.
```@example building_blocks
Data(
   url="https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/us-10m.json",
    format=(type=:topojson, feature=:states),
)
```

To learn more about the formats accepted by Vega-Lite and the properties describing a data source from URL, refer to [Vega-Lite's documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/data.html#url).

### Data generators

Deneb.jl also provides a simple API to define data using any of the [data generators](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/data.html#data-generators) available in Vega-Lite. The generator type (currently Vega-Lite provides a `sequence`, a `graticule` and a `sphere` generator) can be specified as a positional argument of type `String` or `Symbol`, while the properties defining the generator can be specified as keyword arguments.

```@example building_blocks
Data(
    :graticule, step=[15, 15]
) * Mark(:geoshape) * projection(
    :orthographic, rotate=[0, -45, 0]
)
```

## Mark

The `mark` property of a Vega-Lite specification can be defined in Deneb.jl using `Mark`, where the positional argument defines the `mark` type (`point`, `bar`, `line`,...) as a `String` or a `Symbol`.

```@example building_blocks
Mark(:errorband)
```

And the the keyword arguments define the other optional properties of the mark.

```@example building_blocks
Mark(:errorband, extent=:ci, borders=(opacity=0.5, strokeDash=[6, 4]))
```

Refer to [Vega-Lite's documentation](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/mark.html) to learn more about the mark types and their properties.

## Encoding

The `encoding` property of a single view specification represents the mapping between encoding channels (such as `x`, `y`, or `color`) and data fields. In Deneb.jl the `encoding` is defined with `Encoding`, which can optionally take one or two positional arguments representing the the `x` and `y` channels, and any number of keyword arguments representing any arbitrary Vega-Lite channel (including explicit `x`/`y` channels). In the simplest scenario the arguments are of type `String` or `Symbol` representing the `field` property of the given encoding channel.

```@example building_blocks
Encoding(:Horsepower, :Miles_per_Gallon, color=:Origin)
```

### Shorthand string syntax

Similar to Altair, the encoding channels can be defined with a shorthand string syntax to conveniently define the `field`, the `type` and the `aggregate`/`timeUnit` properties of encoding channels. The `type` can be defined by separating the field with a `:` followed by a shorthand type code (`q`: `quantitative`, `o`: `ordinal`, `n`: `nominal`, `t`: `temporal`, `g`: `geojson`).

```@example building_blocks
Encoding("Horsepower:q", "Miles_per_Gallon:q", color="Origin:n")
```

An `aggregate`/`timeUnit` property of encoding channel can also be specified with the shorthand string syntax by wrapping the `field` property with parenthesis and the desired `aggregate`/`timeUnit` function:

```@example building_blocks
Encoding("monthdate(date):t", "mean(temperature):q", color="year(date):o")
```

### Setting other channel properties and the `field` function

To set other channel properties, the `Encoding` channel arguments can be passed as `NamedTuple`s (or `Dict`s) representing the complete channel specification. Note that this works only for explicit keyword channels and not for the method with positional channels.

```@example building_blocks
Encoding(
    x = (
        field=:people, 
        type=:quantitative, 
        aggregate=:sum, 
        title="Total population", 
        scale=(; type=:log)
    )
)
```

Alternatively, the convenient `field` function can be used where the first positional argument can use the shorthand string syntax for fields, and other properties can be set as keyword arguments.

```@example building_blocks
Encoding(
    x = field(
        "sum(people):q",
        title="Total population", 
        scale=(; type=:log)
    )
)
```

### Constant encodings

Constant [visual values](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/value.html) and constant [data values (datum)](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/datum.html) can also be set in Deneb.jl using `Encoding` with `NamedTuple` arguments.

```@example building_blocks
Encoding(
    x=(; datum=10),
    color=(; value="#ff9900")
)
```
